# Music Player

A flutter music app

## About The Project

Music Player is an app that lists all the songs on the local device and allows the user to play them in a normal or random order.

In addition, it is possible to create personalized playlists with your favorite songs that have been saved in a local database.

The app is not in a final version and still has some problems to be solved.
